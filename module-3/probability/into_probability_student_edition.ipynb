    "Probability is a measure quantifying the likelihood that events will occur.\n",

    "[__Frequentist Approach__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequentist probability or frequentism is an interpretation of probability; it defines an event's probability as the limit of its relative frequency in a large number of trials. This interpretation supports the statistical needs of experimental scientists and pollsters; probabilities can be found (in principle) by a repeatable objective process (and are thus ideally devoid of opinion). According to this approach we can define the probability of an event as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(E) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty}\\frac{n(E)}{n}$$\n",

    "[__Bayesian Approach__ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability, in which, instead of frequency of some phenomenon, probability is interpreted as reasonable expectation representing a state of knowledge or as quantification of a personal belief.\n",
